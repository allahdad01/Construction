## Calculations

### **Hourly Contract**
```
Daily Amount = Hours Worked Ã— Hourly Rate
Total Earned = Sum of all daily amounts
```

### **Daily Contract**
```
Hourly Rate = Daily Rate Ã· Working Hours per Day
Daily Amount = Hours Worked Ã— Hourly Rate
Total Earned = Sum of all daily amounts
```

### **Monthly Contract**
```
Hourly Rate = Monthly Rate Ã· Total Required Hours
Daily Amount = Hours Worked Ã— Hourly Rate
Total Earned = Sum of all daily amounts
```

### **Payment Tracking**
```
Remaining Amount = Total Earned - Total Paid
Progress Percentage = (Total Hours Worked Ã· Total Required Hours) Ã— 100
```

## Usage Examples

### **Scenario 1: Hourly Contract**
- Contract: $150/hour
- Day 1: 8 hours = $1,200
- Day 2: 7.5 hours = $1,125
- Total: 15.5 hours = $2,325 earned

### **Scenario 2: Daily Contract**
- Contract: $1,200/day (9 hours standard)
- Day 1: 9 hours = $1,200
- Day 2: 8 hours = $1,066.67
- Total: 17 hours = $2,266.67 earned

### **Scenario 3: Monthly Contract**
- Contract: $15,000/month (270 hours required)
